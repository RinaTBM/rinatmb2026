## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

This is a **Vite + React + TypeScript** static e-commerce frontend ("My Bare Method"). It is a single-page app with a small custom hash/path router (`src/router.tsx`); there is no separate backend server to run for local development. Supabase Edge Functions (`supabase/functions/*`) plus Stripe are used only by the checkout "Place Order" action and are optional external services — the app runs and the full browse/add-to-cart/checkout-form flow works without them.

### Services / commands

There is a single service (the Vite frontend). Standard commands live in `package.json` scripts:

- Dev server: `npm run dev` (serves on http://localhost:5173).
- Lint: `npm run lint` (ESLint). Note: the checked-in code currently has pre-existing lint errors (unused imports, conditional-hook usage) and one `typecheck` error in `src/pages/ProductPage.tsx`. These are code issues, not environment issues — do not treat them as setup failures.
- Typecheck: `npm run typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`).
- Build: `npm run build` — this does a normal `vite build`, then a second SSR build, then runs `node dist/prerender/prerender.js` to prerender ~109 static routes and generate `sitemap.xml`. The build does not run `tsc`, so the pre-existing type error does not block it.
- Preview production build: `npm run preview`.

### Non-obvious notes

- Stripe checkout (the final "Place Order" button on `/checkout`) calls a Supabase Edge Function using `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (read from `import.meta.env`). Without a `.env` providing these, browsing/adding to cart/filling the checkout form all still work; only the final redirect-to-Stripe step will fail. Set those vars in a `.env` file only if you need to exercise real Stripe checkout.
- Node 22 is used here and works with Vite 5.
- Customer account portal (`/account/*`) uses the same browser Supabase anon client as checkout. Auth screens may show an “unavailable until configured” state when local env vars are missing; that does **not** mean Bolt/Supabase is unconfigured. Admin Google auth remains separate (`/admin/*`, `admins` / `is_admin()`). See `docs/customer-account-phase1.md`.

### Bolt Database / migration safety (permanent)

This project uses **Bolt Database backed by Supabase**.

- Cursor/local VM may not have `VITE_SUPABASE_*` or production database credentials.
- Do **not** assume missing local credentials mean Bolt/Supabase is unconfigured.
- Do **not** apply production database migrations from Cursor by default.
- Do **not** request or store production database secrets in source files.
- Prepare migration plans and verification SQL in Cursor.
- Apply approved migrations through Bolt/Supabase only after **explicit user approval**.
- Never run database reset, destructive migration, truncate, or drop commands against production.
- Never run live Stripe sync from Cursor unless the production execution path, credentials, dry-run, and explicit approval are all confirmed.
- Bolt-managed Supabase environment variables and secrets should remain server-side.
- Preserve existing customer, product, membership, Stripe, and admin data.

### Customer account Phase 1 — Bolt deployment checklist

Before the customer account portal can be fully tested in Bolt, manually verify:

1. Apply the approved customer-account migration.
2. Enable Email authentication.
3. Enable Google authentication.
4. Preserve the existing Google admin callback.
5. Add these allowed redirect paths:
   - `/account/auth/callback`
   - `/account/reset-password`
   - `/admin/auth/callback`
6. Configure the production Site URL.
7. Configure the password-reset email template.
8. Test customer signup/login in the actual Bolt/Supabase environment.
